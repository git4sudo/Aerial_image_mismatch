# Satellite-Image-Mismatch

Dstl provides you with 1km x 1km satellite images in both 3-band and 16-band formats. Your goal is to detect and classify the types of objects found in these regions. 3- and 16-bands images There are two types of imagery spectral content provided in this competition. The 3-band images are the traditional RGB natural color images. The 16-band images contain spectral information by capturing wider wavelength channels. This multi-band imagery is taken from the multispectral (400 â€“ 1040nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) (1195-2365nm) range. All images are in GeoTiff format and might require GeoTiff viewers (such as QGIS) to view.

Object types In a satellite image, you will find lots of different objects like roads, buildings, vehicles, farms, trees, water ways, etc. Dstl has labeled 10 different classes: 1> Buildings - large building, residential, non-residential, fuel storage facility, fortified building 
2> Misc. Manmade structures 
3> Road 
4> Track - poor/dirt/cart track, footpath/trail 
5> Trees - woodland, hedgerows, groups of trees, standalone trees 
6> Crops - contour ploughing/cropland, grain (wheat) crops, row (potatoes, turnips) crops 
7> Waterway 
8> Standing water 
9> Vehicle Large - large vehicle (e.g. lorry, truck,bus), logistics vehicle 
10> Vehicle Small - small vehicle (car, van), motorbike
